<p>A wide range of people with different needs working with different
  environments use AwesomeTTS. As such, there are always new features and bugs
  that can crop up, and you can help AwesomeTTS&rsquo;s development by
  reporting problems, making suggestions, writing code, testing new versions,
  and rating the add-on.</p>

<h2>Reporting Bugs and Suggesting New Features</h2>

<p>Users can report problems with the add-on and suggest new features by
  opening a thread on <a href="//anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons"
  rel="external">Anki&rsquo;s add-on support forum</a>. Registration is
  optional.</p>

<h2>Submitting Code and Pull Requests</h2>

<p>Ongoing development happens on <a href="//github.com/AwesomeTTS/AwesomeTTS"
  rel="external">AwesomeTTS&rsquo;s GitHub repository</a>. Interested
  developers can download or clone the source code, make changes, and submit
  pull requests there.</p>

<h2>Test Unreleased Versions</h2>

<p>Follow the <a href="install#other">installation instructions for other
  versions</a> to learn how to obtain unreleased versions of the add-on.</p>

<p>Note that AwesomeTTS&rsquo;s automatic update mechanism will not deliver
  updates for unreleased versions of the add-on until they become official
  stable released versions. If you are using Git, you can periodically use
  <kbd>git pull</kbd> to obtain the latest version of the source code.</p>

<h2>Rate the Add-on</h2>

<p>If you enjoy AwesomeTTS, consider leaving a rating on its
  <a href="//ankiweb.net/shared/info/301952613" rel="external">AnkiWeb add-on
  page</a>. This helps other Anki users discover the add-on.</p>

<h2>Support the Projects on which AwesomeTTS Depends</h2>

<p>Both Anki and many of the backend text-to-speech services that AwesomeTTS
  integrates with are themselves free and open-source projects, often carried
  out by volunteers. Depending on the specific project, you can help by
  reporting problems, fixing bugs, and donating.</p>
