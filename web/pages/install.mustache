<p>Getting AwesomeTTS installed is quick and easy.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>As an add-on, AwesomeTTS cannot be run on its own. If you have not already
  done so, please visit the <a href="http://ankisrs.net" rel="external">Anki
  website</a> to download an installation package for your computer.</p>

<h3>Linux Users</h3>

<p>If you are a Linux user, you can probably obtain Anki from your package
  manager, but you might need to check that you have all needed dependencies
  installed.</p>

<p>For audio playback, both Anki and AwesomeTTS depend on <a rel="external"
  href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">MPlayer</a> (or software with an MPlayer-like
  interface), which can be obtained on most distributions by installing the
  <kbd>mplayer</kbd> or <kbd>mplayer2</kbd> package.</p>

<p>Additionally, AwesomeTTS converts some services&rsquo; raw output to MP3s
  using the <a href="http://lame.sourceforge.net" rel="external">LAME MP3
  Encoder</a>, which can be similarly obtained on most distributions with the
  <kbd>lame</kbd> package.</p>

<h2>Getting the Current Release</h2>

          dialog</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>The current release of the add-on can be downloaded directly from within
  Anki. From Anki&rsquo;s main window&hellip;</p>

<ol>
    <li>go to the <kbd>Tools</kbd> menu</li>
    <li>open the <kbd>Add-ons</kbd> submenu</li>
    <li>select <kbd>Browse &amp; Install&hellip;</kbd></li>
    <li>enter <kbd>301952613</kbd> as the code and hit <kbd>OK</kbd></li>
    <li>once downloaded, restart Anki to enable the add-on</li>
</ol>

<h2>Getting Updates</h2>

<p><strong>As of the v1.0.0 release,</strong> by default, AwesomeTTS will
  check for updates when you open a user profile for the first time in an Anki
  session. Updates can be automatically applied, installed later, or skipped
  as they are released. This functionality can also be turned off entirely on
  the <a href="config/advanced">Advanced tab of the configuration</a>.</p>

<p>If you are on any version of AwesomeTTS that was released <strong>May 2014
  or earlier</strong> (i.e. one that has <strong>alpha</strong> or
  <strong>beta</strong> in its version), you can update your version by
  following the &ldquo;Getting the Current Release&rdquo; instructions
  above. When Anki downloads the add-on code, the old add-on files will be
  overwritten and replaced with the new ones.</p>

<p>See the <a href="//github.com/AwesomeTTS/AwesomeTTS/releases"
  rel="external">version list on GitHub</a> for release notes and changes with
  each version.</a></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="other">Other Versions</h2>

<p>Users who want or need to run a previous version of the add-on can download
  an archive from the <a href="//github.com/AwesomeTTS/AwesomeTTS/releases"
  rel="external">historical release list on GitHub</a>. These releases are no
  longer supported and do not receive any bug fixes.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the most bleeding edge unreleased version of the add-on can
  be downloaded from the <a href="//github.com/AwesomeTTS/AwesomeTTS"
  rel="external">repository GitHub landing page</a> by selecting <kbd>Download
  ZIP</kbd>. These versions will have new features not found in the stable
  release of the add-on, but more bugs, so you can <a href="/contribute">help
  development of the add-on by reporting issues and giving feedback</a>.</p>

<p>Once downloaded, navigate into the top-level of the archive and then into
  <code>addon</code>. From there, extract <code>AwesomeTTS.py</code> and the
  <code>awesometts</code> directory into your Anki <code>addons</code>
  directory. Anki files are <em>usually</em> kept in the Documents directory,
  but might be directly in your home directory if you are using Linux.</p>

<p><em>Note that if you are using Mac OS X with Finder</em> that the default
  operation when copying a directory out of an archive is to completely
  replace the old directory rather than just update the files in it. If you
  want to save your old configuration, either backup <kbd>config.db</kbd>
  beforehand or separately copy the contents of <code>awesometts</code>.</p>

<h3>Git</h3>

<p>Advanced users can also use the add-on via Git by cloning the repository
  from <kbd>https://github.com/AwesomeTTS/AwesomeTTS.git</kbd>. Included are
  scripts to copy or symlink the add-on files to your Anki installation.</p>
